Thank You.

The School info Boxes are currently being worked on. I have completed the School Calendar part.
But the Recent Events and Announcement Boxes are yet to be finished.

Suggestions to improve it are always welcome.
Then based on the design I have started the next section where till now I have completed the photo part.
